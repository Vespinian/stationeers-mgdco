    [b]WARNING:[/b] This is a StationeersMods Plugin Mod. It requires Bepinex to be installed with the StationeersMods plugin.
    See: https://github.com/jixxed/StationeersMods

    [b]WARNING:[/b] This mod is incompatible with my KelvinConsole mod so make sure you disable/unsubscribe it if you have it installed.

    This mod adds a bunch of modes to the gas display consoles which covers pretty much everything the atmospheric analyzer from the tablet gives you.
    There's 63 modes in total so have fun clicking!
    You can use the quantity modifier to backtrack.
    You can also use the filter function of the console to target specific modes or at least get closer to the one you want.
    To use the mod's filter function you will need to hold Left Alt when clicking the confirm button in the filter input menu.
    The filter first checks if you inputted a tag, if it gets no match it tries to match your input to one of the display titles.

    Exepected Behavior:
    [list]
    [*] Temperatures are averaged
    [*] Pressures are averaged
    [*] Ratios are calculated by summing the total amount of moles of the selected gas in every selected device and dividing it by the sum of the total amount of moles in every selected device.
    [*] Mole count is additive.
    [*] Liquid volume is additive.
    [*] Energy values are additive.
