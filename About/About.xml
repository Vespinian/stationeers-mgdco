    [h1]MoreGasDisplayConsoleOptions[/h1]
    [b]WARNING:[/b] This is a StationeersMods Plugin Mod. It requires Bepinex to be installed with the StationeersMods plugin.
    See: https://github.com/jixxed/StationeersMods

    This mod adds a bunch of modes to the gas display consoles which convert pretty much everything the atmospheric analyzer from the tablet gives you.
    There's 60 modes in total so have fun clicking!

    [b]WARNING:[/b] This mod is incompatible with my KelvinConsole mod so make sure you disable/unsubscribe it if you have it installed.

    Exepected Behavior:
    [list]
        [*] Temperatures are averaged
        [*] Pressures are averaged
        [*] Ratios are calculated by summing the total amount of mols of the selected gas in every selected device and dividing it by the sum of the total amount of mols in every selected device.
        [*] Mol count is additive.
        [*] Liquid volume is additive.
        [*] Energy values are additive.
    [/list]
